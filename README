This project explores the use of Google Page Rank as a means to generate key words from and input of simlar documents. 

It is a work in progress and was built to learn about Page Rank, not to create a better keyword classifier.

Currently the algorithm performs poorly compared to conventional keyword generation such as TF-IDF. Generally ranking stop words such as "the" or "it" highest.

Some improvements:
    - Expand to Ngrams or part of speach tags
    - Add the ability to give command line input.

To run on sample data:
    - Install Numpy
    - in terminal type "python run.py"
